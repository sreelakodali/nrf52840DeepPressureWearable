# Proprioception Prosthesis: 2-DOF Arm Movement to Substitutive Deep Pressure
Code for nrf52840 (Seeed XIAO BLE Sense) for proprioception prosthesis. The microcontroller's onboard inertial measurement unit (IMU) measures arm angle and maps the arm position to different deep pressure stimuli. Examples are included on how to use the library and update the mapping.
